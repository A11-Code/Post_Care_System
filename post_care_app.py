This application demonstrates the *concept* of an NLP-powered phone call assistant.
**Please note:** Direct phone calls from a web browser are not possible.
This setup assumes integration with a service like Twilio for actual call handling and
real-time speech-to-text/text-to-speech for the conversation.

**Technical Breakdown (What you'd need beyond this Streamlit app):**
1.  **Twilio (or similar CPaaS):** For making the outbound call and handling incoming audio via webhooks.
2.  **Speech-to-Text (STT) API:** To convert live audio from the call into text (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, AWS Transcribe, Azure Speech).
3.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP) API/Model:** To understand the intent, entities, sentiment, and generate appropriate responses (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face models, Google Cloud NLP).
4.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS) API:** To convert the NLP-generated responses back into spoken audio to be played back to the caller (e.g., Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, AWS Polly, Azure Speech).
5.  **Webhook Backend:** A server (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Node.js) to receive webhooks from Twilio (audio streams/events), process them with STT/NLP/TTS, and send instructions back to Twilio.
6.  **Database:** To store the conversation logs persistently.
